# CSS
Cascading Style Sheets is used to design the website to make it look better. <br>
- CSS gives style to raw HTML and our web pages
- CSS is used to make website responsive.

Responsive means that the site will behave accordingly to the different screen sizes. For ex. while looking in mobile phone and laptops, site should automatically change its styling. <br> 
## 3 ways to include CSS
1. Inline CSS
2. Internal CSS file

If all three types of styling are present then the inline styling takes preference. <br>
Inline Styling > Internal CSS > External CSS <br>
