# CSS- Cascading Style Sheets

Cascading Style Sheets is used to design the website to make it look better. <br>
- CSS gives style to raw HTML and our web pages
- CSS is used to make the website responsive.

Responsive means that the site will behave accordingly to the different screen sizes. For example, while looking at mobile phones and laptops, the site should automatically change its styling. <br>

Inline Styling > Internal CSS Styling > External CSS Styling <br>
